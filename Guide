Dynamic Car Rental System in Java. In this project we have create structure classes,smooth Car rental interactions, and seamless prices calculation. This user-friendly console interface is created using core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, fostering the development of an effective and well-organized software system.

Step 1: Project Setup
Start by setting up a new Java project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Ensure that you have Java installed on your system.

Step 2: Define the Car Class
Create a 'Car' class to represent individual vehicles. Include attributes such as make, model, year, and rental status. Implement appropriate constructors and methods to set and retrieve information about each car.

Step 3: Implement the CarRentalSystem Class
Create a 'CarRentalSystem' class that manages the collection of cars, rental transactions, and price calculations. This class will serve as the core of our car rental system.

Step 4: Develop a User Interface
Build a simple console-based user interface to interact with the CarRentalSystem. Utilize the Scanner class to take user input and display relevant information.

Step 5: Refine Rental Transactions and Pricing Logic
Inside the 'CarRentalSystem' class, refine the methods responsible for handling rental transactions and calculating prices. Consider factors such as rental duration, additional services, and any discounts.

Step 6: Test Your Car Rental System
Create test cases within your 'CarRentalApp' to ensure that all functionalities work as expected. Validate the accurate calculation of prices and proper handling of rental transactions.
